## Design a card
Simply think of your favorite Biblical hero or event, and create something that makes sense in that context. Slight violations of the color pie are acceptable.

Some considerations:
* Absolutely no advocation nor condoning of sexual violence.
* Smiting sinful individuals and Armogeddening an entire city are acceptable acts and concepts, as are horrible diseases, plagues and Divine mind control.
* We prefer that everything comes directly from the Bible. References to Deuterocanonical works are gladly included.
* Cards can suggest, imply or compel that a Biblical character made an alternate choice otherwise not described in the original story if it makes for a better card or interesting thought.
## Make some Art
